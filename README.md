# tester

Light-weight tester library for go

## Rationale

There are a number of good features in go's standard testing library. However, sometimes all we need is just a little extra. Not a "boiling-the-ocean"-style testing libraries, but a simple one with just a handful of features. Hopefully the ones just we need.

## Goals

Apart from having just a handful of assertions, I plan to add items with a high chance of frequent usage.

## Contribute
